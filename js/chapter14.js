// SCOPE

// var, let, and const are block-scoped variables
// all these keywords are used to declare variables

// from 1995 to 2015, var was the only way to declare variables in JavaScript
var x = 10;

// With the introduction of let and const, we cannot declare the same variable twice
// With let, you can reassign the value of a variable (let me reassign)
// With const, you cannot reassign the value of a variable (constant)
