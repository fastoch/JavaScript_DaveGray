## Intro

- JavaScript (JS) adds functionality and interactivity to the web!
- JavaScript can make things happen when users interact with our web pages.
- JavaScript completes the "3 Pillars of the Web" when combined with HTML and CSS
- For the last decade, JavaScript has been the most popular programming language in the world!

I created this free 8 hour JavaScript course with 28 chapters to help you learn the fundamentals.  
This is the stage where you truly begin to learn "web development".

## Chapter 1 

### Comments 

A JS comment starts with 2 slashes `//`

### Data Types

There are 4 basic data types:
- string (double quotes or simple quotes)
- 

We can use `typeof` to check the data type: 
- `typeof "Dave";` will return "string"
- `typeof 42;` will return "number"
- `typeof true;` will return "boolean"
- 

### Variables

We can define a variable with the keyword `let`: `let myVariable;`
