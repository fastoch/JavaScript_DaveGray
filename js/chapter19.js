// JSON - JavaScript Object Notation
/*
JSON is a text format that is completely language-independent.
Therefore, JSON is used to send and receive data in many languages, not just in JavaScript.
In Web Dev, we usually send & receive data between a web browser (the client) and the server hosting the application.
